MAKE NOTATIONAL NOTE ABOUT VARIABLES THAT ARE UPPERCASE VS LOWERCASE


we can reason about unknowns given evidence
if we have n variables each with domain of size d, then our joint probability table will be size $d^n$ -- this is bad!!

two variables are independent if for all x, y P(x)P(y) = P(x, y) -- their distributions FACTOR into simpler distributions

assuming independence is a simplifying modeling assumption

conditional independence is very useful - more useful than unconditinoal independence because it mmeans variables don't interact with one another
P(x,y | z) = P(x | z)P(y | z)

examples

application of chain rule, then simplyfying with conditional independence - EXPLAIN THIS CAREFULLY

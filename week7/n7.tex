\section{Decision Networks}
Decision networks combine Bayes' Nets with additional node types for actions and utilities, and are a neat way to represent a general decision problem with uncertainty.

Decision networks consist of the three types of nodes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Change nodes (ovals):
\item Action nodes (rectangles): 
\item Utility nodes (diamonds):
\end{itemize}

[An example of decision network here:]

Once we have a decision problem represented by a decision network, we can solve the decision problem, i.e., select the action that maximizes the expected utility, by the following algorithm. 

[action selection algorithm goes here: Page 628 in Russell's book or Page 13 in the slides]



\section{The Value of Information}
In the previous lectures, we assume that all relevant information is provided to the agent before it makes its decision. In practice, this is hardly the case. \textit{One of the most important parts of decision making is knowing what information to acquire.} [An example here]. This section will introduce an important notion - \textbf{value of perfect information} (VPI) - which quantifies the additional expected utility the agent would gain if it obtains the evidence and then acts versus if it acts without the evidence.


\subsection{General Formula}
To derive a general formula for VPI, let us first review the definitions for the expected utility (EU) and maximum expected utility (MEU).

[how EU and MEU are defined and then go to the general formula of VPI]
